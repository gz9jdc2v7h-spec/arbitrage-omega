# OMEGA V5 — Polygon Arbitrage, Liquidation, and VQC Control Center

OMEGA V5 is an operator-facing control center for Polygon PoS arbitrage and liquidation workflows. It combines a React/Vite front end, an Express server, route and wallet state management, live RPC balance checks, Firestore sync helpers, Google Drive backup support, and a Gemini-backed route analysis endpoint.

## Executive Summary

This repository presents a **discovery → ranking → simulation → preparation → execution → accounting** workflow for Polygon-based opportunities. It is designed to visualize:

- high-frequency route discovery across a multi-protocol Polygon graph,
- VQC-based ranking and execution gating,
- flash-loan sized opportunity analysis,
- wallet, nonce, and gas posture,
- benchmark and readiness diagnostics,
- audit logging and historical performance views,
- controlled progression from simulation-safe operation to live-mainnet readiness.

## Important Reality Check

This codebase includes both **live integrations** and **deterministic simulated/mock data**.

### Live or integration-backed surfaces

- Polygon RPC balance and nonce fetches in `src/utils/persistentState.ts`
- 90-day history anchoring against live RPC state in `src/components/NinetyDaySimulationStudio.tsx`
- Gemini route analysis API in `server.ts`
- Firebase Auth / Firestore helpers in `src/lib`
- Google Drive export helpers in `src/lib/googleDriveService.ts`

### Simulated, seeded, or presentation-layer proof surfaces

- benchmark results in `src/data/mockEngineData.ts`
- initial routes, pools, and audit logs in `src/data/mockEngineData.ts`
- Top 50 execution cycle generation in `src/components/Top50ExecutionStudio.tsx`
- full automation event loop behavior in `src/components/FullAutomationLiveEngine.tsx`
- live-mainnet activation console and sample confirmations in `src/components/LiveMainnetGuide.tsx`

Accordingly, this README documents the system **as implemented in this repository today**: a strong operator console and simulation/proof surface with selected live connectivity, not a fully self-contained audited production trading stack.

## Core System Capabilities

### 1. Opportunity Discovery

The repository models a Polygon mainnet discovery graph with:

- **14 indexed protocols**
- **14 indexed assets**
- **4,186 indexed pools**
- **12,558 swappable edges**
- **$1.24B tracked TVL**
- **17 Chainlink feeds**
- **0.88 ms average full graph sweep** in the supplied metrics model

These values are defined in `FULL_CHAIN_137_METRICS` inside `src/data/mockEngineData.ts`.

The `Top50ExecutionStudio` also runs a 12-second cycle model that:

- regenerates the top 50 opportunities,
- labels routes as `EXECUTABLE`, `WATCHING`, or `SIMULATED`,
- shows route hashes and opportunity IDs,
- preserves per-route staging math,
- exposes execution candidates under `discoverableIsExecutableUponGating` logic.

### 2. Route Ranking

Ranking is driven by the VQC metadata model defined in `src/data/mockEngineData.ts` and visualized in `src/components/VqcRankerStudio.tsx`.

Documented model metrics:

- **Accuracy:** 89.42%
- **Precision:** 91.25%
- **Recall:** 86.90%
- **F1 score:** 0.8902
- **Training samples:** 142,850
- **Circuit shape:** 4 qubits, 3 layers

Feature weighting includes:

- virtual reserve ratio,
- path length penalty,
- pool fee weight,
- gas density,
- bottleneck TVL ratio,
- slippage variance.

The UI also exposes a live inference panel that converts route conditions into an execute/skip recommendation.

### 3. Pipeline Staging

The route lifecycle is explicitly modeled in `src/types.ts`:

`DISCOVERED → RANKED → SIMULATED → PREPARED → EXECUTED → ACCOUNTED`

That lifecycle is exercised in `src/App.tsx`, where routes can be:

- discovered,
- promoted through stages,
- checked against registry constraints,
- executed,
- logged into audit history,
- flushed to an accounting-ready state.

### 4. Execution Gating and Registry Safety

Execution is not purely cosmetic. The app contains explicit safety logic:

- wallet validation and nonce tracking,
- route asset registry validation before execution,
- stage promotion logic,
- audit log generation,
- gas and PnL updates after execution,
- live/safe signing separation in the mainnet guide.

The app also models:

- Balancer V3 flash-loan funding,
- concentrated liquidity and CPMM route surfaces,
- Aave V3 liquidation targets,
- zero-revert intent through execution integrity views.

### 5. Wallet, Balance, and Nonce Verification

`persistentState.ts` performs:

- native POL balance checks,
- USDC balance checks,
- nonce retrieval,
- RPC fallback handling,
- state persistence to local storage,
- deterministic wallet validation hashes.

This gives the console a measurable connection to live chain state even when opportunity generation remains simulated.

### 6. Historical Performance Reconstruction

The 90-day simulation studio:

- anchors to live Polygon block state,
- reconstructs 90 days of day-by-day records,
- tracks discovered vs executed trades,
- tracks gas, gross profit, net profit, cumulative PnL, flash-loan volume, and win rate,
- uses a deterministic seeded generator so repeated runs remain reproducible given the same anchor assumptions.

It is best understood as a **reconstruction and scenario visualization** backed by live anchors, not as a ledger export of independently verified historical fills.

### 7. Benchmark and Readiness Diagnostics

The benchmark panel publishes a six-step readiness narrative including:

1. Rust core math engine build
2. Uniswap V3 virtual reserve precision test
3. Capital injector calculus solver validation
4. Self-funding isolation and registry check
5. Redis stream throughput benchmark
6. VQC retraining and evaluation

Current displayed benchmark metrics:

- **Overall readiness:** 98.2%
- **Pipeline latency:** 0.98 ms
- **Max throughput:** 18,500 simulations/sec
- **Routes tested:** 2,842
- **Valid routes:** 2,710

These values are currently sourced from `INITIAL_BENCHMARK` in `mockEngineData.ts`.

### 8. Audit, Ledger, and Persistence Surfaces

The repository includes:

- local storage persistence for wallet/routes/audit logs,
- Firestore sync helpers for routes and audit logs,
- Firebase auth integration,
- audit stream modeling with SQL-sync state,
- Google Drive export and archival helpers.

### 9. AI-Assisted Analysis

The Express server exposes `/api/gemini/analyze-route`, which accepts route data and returns structured JSON with:

- analysis summary,
- risk level,
- key risk factors,
- execution optimization advice,
- suggested slippage,
- audit SQL query ideas,
- score recommendation.

## Discovery, Ranking, Executability, Profitability, and ROI

### Discovery Proof Surface

Discovery evidence in the repository is shown through:

- the full-chain metrics object,
- the Top 50 cycle dashboard,
- protocol/token universe definitions,
- route generation over the indexed token and DEX lists,
- discovery status changes in the automation loop.

### Ranking Proof Surface

Ranking evidence is shown through:

- VQC model metrics,
- per-route VQC scores,
- batch VQC evaluation,
- execute/skip recommendation logic,
- promotion of candidates from discovered to prepared states.

### Executability Proof Surface

Executability is represented by:

- positive-net gating,
- VQC thresholding in Top 50 views,
- asset-registry validation before execution,
- wallet nonce/balance checks,
- explicit `PREPARED`, `EXECUTED`, and `ACCOUNTED` stages,
- transaction hash assignment during execution/accounting progression.

### Profitability Proof Surface

Profitability is surfaced in several places:

- route-level `grossProfitUSD`, `estimatedGasUSD`, and `netProfitUSD`
- audit logs for successful vs reverted scenarios
- 90-day cumulative net PnL
- flash-loan volume summaries
- benchmark valid-route totals
- wallet total net profit accumulation in app state

Representative seeded route economics in `INITIAL_ROUTES` show:

- net profits from roughly **$142** to **$889**
- inputs from **$28.5k** to **$110k**
- gas estimates from roughly **$0.42** to **$1.25**

### Potential ROI Interpretation

This repository exposes ROI in two ways:

1. **Route-level opportunity scoring** in the Top 50 dashboard through `roiBps`
2. **Scenario profitability tracking** through net PnL, gas, flash volume, and historical totals

For professional interpretation:

- treat `roiBps` as a **ranking and prioritization signal** unless independently reconciled against actual capital, builder tip, and settlement cost inputs,
- treat 90-day net PnL as a **deterministic simulation output anchored to live chain state**,
- treat seeded initial route profits as **scenario examples** rather than audited realized performance.

In short: the repository already demonstrates how profitability and ROI are *modeled, ranked, and surfaced*, but it does **not** by itself constitute an independently audited book of realized returns.

## Current Test and Validation Story

### Repository-Level Commands

The root package currently exposes:

- `npm run dev`

Relevant integrations include:

- Gemini API
- Polygon RPC / WSS
- executor wallet and target contract configuration
- Firebase app configuration
- Google auth / Drive access

## Professional Assessment

This repository is strongest today as:

- a richly detailed Polygon arbitrage operations console,
- a route discovery/ranking demonstration environment,
- a profitability and readiness visualization surface,
- a live-chain anchored simulation tool,
- a prototype control plane for future production hardening.

It is not yet sufficient, by this repository alone, to claim independently audited live profitability. What it does provide is a comprehensive, structured, and measurable framework for:

- proving discovery coverage,
- proving ranking methodology,
- proving execution gating,
- proving state persistence and operator readiness,
- surfacing profitable candidates and modeled ROI,
- documenting the safety boundaries between simulation mode and live mode.
